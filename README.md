# 💥 Impulse Buy Simulator – Full Stack Review & Pair Challenge

Welcome to the *Impulse Buy Simulator*, a quirky web app designed to simulate (and celebrate) poor purchasing decisions. But more importantly — this is your chance to review a complete full-stack project and help make it better.

## 🎯 What You'll Be Doing

You’ll dive into a real, working codebase that uses:

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Material UI (MUI) + React Router + useContext
- **Backend:** Express.js + MongoDB (with Mongoose)

Then, you’ll:
1. **Explore** the app and source code.
2. **Identify** bugs, areas for improvement, and new feature ideas.
3. **Pair up** and implement a change together.

## 🧭 Step 1: Orientation

Start by running the app and exploring it:
- Browse silly items.
- Add things to your cart.
- Check out the Admin panel to upload new impulse buys.

Take note of how it looks, feels, and behaves — both as a user and as a developer.

## 🔍 Step 2: Code Review

Work alone or in small groups to answer:
- What's working well?
- What’s broken, confusing, or inefficient?
- Is there anything missing or worth adding?
- How could the code be cleaner, safer, or easier to maintain?

Make a list of:
- 🐞 Bugs  
- ✨ Feature ideas  
- 🧹 Code improvements

## 🛠 Step 3: Pair Programming Challenge

Choose one thing from your list and **pair up** with someone to build it.

Your mission as a team:
- Create a Git branch for your work
- Build and test the improvement
- Be ready to show it off at the end!

Examples of great things to build:
- Add a search or filter bar
- Add form validation to the Admin page
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Create a checkout confirmation page
- Display quantity in the cart
- Refactor repeated code
- Handle loading/error states
- Improve accessibility or keyboard navigation

---

## 🤔 Step 4: Reflect & Share

At the end of the session, we’ll come together to:
- Share what you built (live or a quick walkthrough)
- Talk about what went well and what was tricky
- Reflect on what you learned about working with a full-stack project

## 💬 Final Thought

This is a chance to get hands-on with a real-world(ish) app, practice identifying tech debt and opportunities, and build collaboratively. Whether you're fixing a bug or adding a whole new feature, your improvements make the app better and your skills sharper.

Let’s make this the most ridiculous, polished impulse-buy store on the internet. 🚀
